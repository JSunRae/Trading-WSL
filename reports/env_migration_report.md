# Environment Migration Report (Phase 1 & Phase 2 Update)

## Scope

Phase 1: Initial extraction of environment-driven configuration keys from `core/config.py` defaults and preliminary scan of repository for hardcoded values (ports, paths, filenames).

Phase 2 (Completed Aug 17 2025): Migration of selected high-duplication tool scripts (`verify_setup.py`, `record_depth.py`) to remove hardcoded IB host/port literals and implement standardized `--describe` metadata output. Report artifacts updated.

## Extracted Keys

See `env_keys.json` for machine-readable list. Total: 33.

## Hardcoded Patterns Identified (Examples)

- IB Ports (7496, 7497, 4001, 4002) repeated across: record_depth.py, setup_ib_gateway.py, quick_start.py, verify_setup.py, headless_gateway.py, run_trading_fully_automated.py, reconnect utilities.
- Host `127.0.0.1` embedded in connection calls (should use IB_HOST).
- Directory names like `Level2` and `IBDownloads` properly parameterized in config but still mentioned directly in some scripts.

## Planned Migration Steps (Phase 1) & Phase 2 Execution Status

1. Replace literal port/host usages in tools with lookups from `get_config().ib_connection` or helper functions. ✅ (verify_setup, record_depth)
2. Add accessor helpers for commonly displayed guidance strings (e.g., port mapping descriptions) to avoid duplication. ⏳ (helper centralization pending; current implementation derives dynamically per tool)
3. Generate `.env.example` from `env_keys.json`. ✅ (previously completed)
4. Introduce validation script to diff `.env.example` vs actual `.env` and report missing keys. ⏳ (script placeholder, not yet added)
5. Extend tests to cover config access (paper vs live mode, gateway vs TWS ports). ⏳ (follow-up test tickets required)
6. Standardize `--describe` output across migration-targeted tools. ✅ (verify_setup, record_depth now emit structured JSON)
7. Refresh reporting artifacts after tool migration. ✅ (manifest timestamp, this report updated)

### Phase 2 Outputs

- `src/tools/verify_setup.py` updated: config-driven port guidance, standardized `--describe`.
- `src/tools/record_depth.py` fully refactored & simplified: removed literals, added port auto-detection, standardized `--describe`, improved snapshot/message persistence, added structured dataclasses.
- `reports/script_manifest.json` timestamp refreshed.
- This report amended to reflect Phase 2 completion.

### Remaining Follow-Ups (Post Phase 2)

- Centralize shared port selection / description banner logic (avoid duplication between tools).
- Add test coverage for `--describe` schema validation.
- Add environment validation script (placeholder step 4) to ensure all keys present.
- Incremental refactor of larger service modules (see architecture audit) to adopt the same patterns.

## Risk & Impact

- Minimal runtime risk if defaults preserved; ensure logging clarity after migration.
- Need to verify that interactive guidance scripts still readable after dynamic substitution.

## Next

Proceed with literal replacement in selected high-duplication scripts (record_depth, setup_ib_gateway, quick_start) and add `--describe` where missing.
