"""Deprecated legacy module: MasterPy_Trading.

All legacy contents removed. The last remaining class (`BarCLS`) was
retired from production (tests now use `tests/helpers/legacy_bar.py::BarClsTestShim`).

Removal schedule:
        * Soft deprecation warning emitted on import.
        * Final removal (file deletion) planned: 2025-09-30.

Action required: eliminate any remaining thirdâ€‘party imports of
`src.MasterPy_Trading` (or `MasterPy_Trading`) before the removal date.

If some external code still needs interval formatting, implement a
project-local helper or adopt modern services directly.
